# RaveForce
RaveForce is an environment that allows you to define your musical task in SuperCollider, and train an agent to do the task in Python with APIs similar to the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com).

## SuperCollider

To use it, copy the ```Extensions``` folder to the SuperCollider ```Open user support directory```. You can find it in the ```File``` menu of the SuperCollider IDE.

Recompile the SuperCollider library. You can find the command and shortcut in the ```Language``` menu of SuperCollider IDE.

An example code to run is as below:

```
(
SynthDef(\sin, { |freq, att=0.01, rel=0.49|
	var sig, freq_range;
	freq_range = freq.linexp(0, 1, 20, 22000);
	sig = SinOsc.ar(freq_range!2);
	sig = sig * Env.perc(att, rel).kr(2);
	Out.ar(0, sig);
}).load;

p = Pbind(
	\instrument, \sin,
	\freq, 2000,
	\dur, 0.5,
);

RaveForce.start(p, key: \freq, bpm:30, total_step:1);

// start the task with the pattern we define
// key states which parameters to control, in this example, the frequency is the only one for the agent to choose
)
```

The total step of one means every time the pattern reaches the total step, the pattern will be rendered.

Typically, the workflow is:

- Python sends parameters
- SC reads the paramters and render the pattern in non-real-time with the length of current step
- Python reads the audio output and train the neural networks
- Repreat

## Python

After the SuperCollider code is running, command can be sent from Python.

Jupyter notebook is recommended for the training.

```
import raveforce

env = raveforce.make("continuous", 1) // one continuous parameter is between 0 to 1
observation = env.reset()
action = env.action_space.sample()
observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
env.render()
```
